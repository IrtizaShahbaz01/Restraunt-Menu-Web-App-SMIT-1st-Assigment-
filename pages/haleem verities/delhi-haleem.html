    <h1>Delhi Haleem</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Delhi Haleem is a rich and flavorful dish that combines the goodness of lentils, meat, and spices. It is a slow-cooked stew made with a variety of lentils, wheat, barley, and meat, typically beef or mutton. The dish is seasoned with a blend of aromatic spices, including ginger, garlic, and garam masala, which infuse the haleem with a warm and comforting flavor. Delhi Haleem is traditionally enjoyed during the holy month of Ramadan, where it is served as a nourishing and satisfying meal to break the fast. The dish is often garnished with fried onions, fresh coriander, and a squeeze of lemon juice, adding a burst of freshness to the rich and hearty stew.</p>
