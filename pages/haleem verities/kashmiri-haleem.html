    <h1>Kashmiri Haleem</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Kashmiri haleem is a rich and aromatic stew made from a blend of wheat, barley, lentils, and meat, slow-cooked to perfection. This traditional dish is popular in Kashmir, India, and is often enjoyed during the holy month of Ramadan. The slow cooking process allows the flavors to meld together, creating a hearty and aromatic dish that is both comforting and nourishing. Kashmiri haleem is typically garnished with fried onions, fresh herbs, and a squeeze of lemon juice, adding a burst of freshness to the rich and savory stew.</p>
