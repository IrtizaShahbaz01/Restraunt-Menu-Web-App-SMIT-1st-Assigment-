    <h1>Gulab Jamun</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Gulab Jamun is a popular Indian dessert made from khoya, which is milk solids kneaded into a dough, deep-fried, and then soaked in a sugar syrup flavored with rose water or cardamom. The name itself means "rose berries" due to the rose water syrup and the berry-like shape of the sweets. Gulab Jamun is often enjoyed during festivals, celebrations, and as a post-meal dessert. Its rich, sweet flavor and soft, melt-in-the-mouth texture make it a beloved treat across South Asia and beyond.</p>
