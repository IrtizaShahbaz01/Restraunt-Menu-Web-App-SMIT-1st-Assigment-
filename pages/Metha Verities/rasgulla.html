    <h1>Rasgulla</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Rasgulla is a delectable dessert originating from the Indian subcontinent, particularly famous in West Bengal and Odisha. It is made from chenna (Indian cottage cheese) that is kneaded into dough, shaped into small balls, and cooked in light syrup made of sugar. The spongy, soft texture and the mildly sweet taste of the syrup make rasgulla a refreshing and light dessert. It is often enjoyed chilled, especially during festivals and special occasions. The simplicity and delightful taste of rasgulla have made it a favorite across many regions.</p>
