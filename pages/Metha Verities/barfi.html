    <h1>Barfi</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Barfi is a dense milk-based sweet from the Indian subcontinent, often flavored with fruits or nuts. The base of barfi is usually made from condensed milk solids (khoya) and sugar. Variations include adding ingredients like cocoa (for chocolate barfi), coconut, or ground nuts. It is usually cut into square or diamond shapes and sometimes decorated with edible silver leaf (vark). Barfi is enjoyed during festivals, weddings, and other celebrations, and its rich, sweet flavor makes it a favorite among many.</p>
