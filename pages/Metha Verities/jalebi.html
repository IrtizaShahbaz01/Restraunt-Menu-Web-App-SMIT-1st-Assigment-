    <h1>Jalebi</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Jalebi is a popular sweet snack in South Asia and the Middle East. It is made by deep-frying a wheat flour batter in a spiral shape, which is then soaked in sugar syrup. The result is a crunchy, syrupy sweet that is often served hot. Jalebi is enjoyed during various festivities and is sometimes served with a contrasting dish like yogurt or rabri (condensed milk). Its bright orange color and distinctive shape make it visually appealing, and its sweet, crispy texture is loved by people of all ages.</p>
