    <hr>
    <p>Halwa is a dense, sweet confection made from a base of flour (such as semolina or wheat), sugar, and ghee, often flavored with cardamom and garnished with nuts. There are many types of halwa, including suji (semolina) halwa, gajar (carrot) halwa, and moong dal halwa. Each variety offers a unique texture and flavor, ranging from the grainy and aromatic suji halwa to the rich and creamy gajar halwa. Halwa is enjoyed during festive occasions and as a comforting dessert, known for its warmth and satisfying sweetness.</p>
