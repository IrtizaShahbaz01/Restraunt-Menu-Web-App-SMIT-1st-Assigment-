    <h1>Kheer</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Kheer is a creamy, rice-based pudding that is a staple dessert in many South Asian households. It is made by simmering rice with milk and sugar, and is often flavored with cardamom, saffron, and various nuts like almonds and pistachios. The slow-cooking process results in a rich, thick texture that is both comforting and indulgent. Kheer is typically served during festivals, weddings, and special family gatherings. Its smooth, creamy consistency and sweet flavor make it a favorite among dessert lovers.</p>
